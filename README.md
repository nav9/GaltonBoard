# To install and run  
It is recommended that you install Python as part of a virtual environment like PyEnv so that it does not mess up your system's Python. Python3 is preferred.  
Install dependent libraries:  
`pip3 install pygame`  
`pip3 install pymunk`  
Using the commandline, enter the "main" folder and run the program from the commandline using:   
`python3 main.py`  
  
Note: The extra project files are those of LiClipse.
